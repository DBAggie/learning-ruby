# learning-ruby
I am learning Ruby. This is just some files I made while learning

## How to use this Repo
Clone the repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DBAggie/learning-ruby.git
```

Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
I will be using VSCode for my examples.

Once you have opened the folder in your code editor bring up your preferred code editor.
Hotkey for this in VSCode is CTRL+~ or you can click on the Terminal option in the top left.

In your terminal, run a file using the below code example. You will see the output appear in the console. Some programs will require user input. Please submit either a ticket or Pull Request for any updates to make this more Beginner friendly.

#### How to run a file
```bash
    ruby ./1-Super-Beginner/1-Vars-Ifs-Operators.rb
```
Remember you can use the Tab key to autocomplete the name for you.

For instance: ruby ./1-Sup <== At this point you can click Tab and it will complete for you

Next you will see: ./1-Super-Beginner/1-Va  <== Let's finish up here and use tab complete to get our filename

This will give you: ././1-Super-Beginner/1-Vars-Ifs-Operators.rb

Voila! You are running the files. Create your own while you are at it!
